* [x] - borrow ideas from https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-enhanced
	There are several plugins that come bundled with sublime-enhanced. The first
	one and probably the most important has to do with key-bindings for better
	mouseless file navigation.
	It proposes a scheme where the following keys are used:
							up (i)
					left (j)	right (l)
							down (k)
	The problem is that vim-bindings are too engrained into my fingertips and
	therefore it is difficult to stick to anything else. Furthermore going
	forward with anything else than vim-keybindings will set me on my own path.
	Therefore probably check neo-vintage to start with.
* [x] - :READ: what is the usefullness of the files:
			"Package Control.merged-ca-bundle"
			"Package Control.user-ca-bundle"
			"oscrypto-ca-bundle.crt"
* [x] - Package cleanup
* [ ] - Go through each package and see what provided functionality is used.
	In case of duplicates remove packages.
* [ ] - :READ: NeoVintagous package usage
	check sublime-six package (better than neo-vintageous ???)
* [ ] - better folding for C code
	* [ ] - fold labels
	* [ ] - fold #ifdefs
